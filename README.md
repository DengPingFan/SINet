The SINet-V2 can surpass the performance of existing COD methods by a large margin, while maintaining real-time inference.
- [2020/10/22] :boom: **Training code could be avaliable via email (dengpfan@gmail.com).** Please provide your Name & Institution. Please note the code can be only used for research purpose.
- [2020/11/21] Upadted evaluated tool: Bi_cam(cam>threshold)=1 -> Bi_cam(cam>=threshold)=1;
- [2020/10/22] For eq (4): j = k+1, M -> j = m, k-1. (note that m is a specific layer, in our paper it should be equal to 1).
- [2020/09/09] SINet is the best method on the open benchmark website (https://paperswithcode.com/task/camouflaged-object-segmentation).
- [2020/08/27] Updated the describtion in Table 3 (Baseline models are trained using the training setting (iii) rather than (iv)). 
- [2020/08/05] Online demo has been released! (http://mc.nankai.edu.cn/cod).

## 1. Task Relationship

<p align="center">
    <img src="./Images/Relationship.png"/> <br />
    <em> 
    Figure 1: Task relationship. Given an input image (a), we present the ground-truth for (b) panoptic segmentation
    (which detects generic objects including stuff and things), (c) salient object detection (which detects isolated 
    objects that grasp human attention), and (d) the proposed concealed object detection task, where the goal is to 
    detect objects that have a similar pattern to the natural habitat. In this example, the boundaries of the two 
    butterflies are blended with the bananas, making them difficult to identify..

    Figure 2: Given an input image (a), we present the ground-truth for (b) panoptic segmentation 
    (which detects generic objects including stuff and things), (c) salient instance/object detection 
    (which detects objects that grasp human attention), and (d) the proposed camouflaged object detection task, 
    where the goal is to detect objects that have a similar pattern (e.g., edge, texture, or color) to the natural habitat. 
    In this case, the boundaries of the two butterflies are blended with the bananas, making them difficult to identify. 
    This task is far more challenging than the traditional salient object detection or generic object detection.

## 2. Proposed Baseline

### 2.1. Overview

<p align="center">
    <img src="./Images/SINet.png"/> <br />
    <em> 
    Figure 3: Overview of our SINet framework, which consists of two main components: the receptive field (RF) 
    and partial decoder component (PDC). The RF is introduced to mimic the structure of RFs in the human visual system. 
    The PDC reproduces the search and identification stages of animal predation. 
    SA = search attention function described in [71]. See x 4 for details.
    </em>
</p>

### 2.2. Usage

The training and testing experiments are conducted using [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) with 
a single GeForce RTX TITAN GPU of 24 GB Memory.

> Note that our model also supports low memory GPU, which means you can lower the batch size
(~419 MB per image in `apex-mode=O1`, and ~305 MB per image in `apex-mode=O2`)


1. Configuring your environment (Prerequisites):
   
    Note that SINet is only tested on Ubuntu OS with the following environments. 
    It may work on other operating systems as well but we do not guarantee that it will.
    
    + Creating a virtual environment in terminal: `conda create -n SINet python=3.6`.
    
    + Installing necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    
    + (Optional: only for training) Installing [NVIDIA-Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) 
    for accelerate training process with mixed precision. 
    [(Instructions)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex#linux) (Under CUDA-10.0 and Cudnn-7.4).

<!--2. Downloading Testing Sets: -->
2. Downloading Training and Testing Sets:
    + downloading _**NEW testing dataset**_ (COD10K-test + CAMO-test + CHAMELEON) and move it into `./Dataset/TestDataset/`, 
    which can be found in this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QEGnP9O7HbN_2tH999O3HRIsErIVYalx/view?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Pan link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/143yHFLAabMBT7wgXA0LrMg) with the fetch code: z83z.
    
    + download **_NEW training dataset_** (COD10K-train) which can be found in this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D9bf1KeeCJsxxri6d2qAC7z6O1X_fxpt/view?usp=sharing) or [Baidu Pan link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XL6OjpDF-MVnXOY6-bdaBg) with the fetch code:djq2.  Please refer to our original paper for other training data. 
    
<!-- + download **_NEW training dataset_** (COD10K-train + CAMO-train) and move it into `./Dataset/TrainDataset/`, which can be found in this [download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D9bf1KeeCJsxxri6d2qAC7z6O1X_fxpt/view?usp=sharing). -->
    

<!--3. Training Configuration:

    + Assigning your customed path, like `--save_model`, `--train_img_dir`, and `--train_gt_dir` in `MyTrain.py`.
    
    + Just run it! -->

3. Testing Configuration:

    + After you download all the pre-trained model and testing data, just run `MyTest.py` to generate the final prediction map: 
    replace your trained model directory (`--model_path`) and assign your the save directory of the inferred mask (`--test_save`)
    
    + Note that we re-trained our model (marked as $\diamondsuit$ in the following figure) equipped with mixed training 
    strategy of Apex lib (`mode=O1`) and get better performance in 40 epoch. Here we provide a new pre-trained model 
    ([Baidu Drive [fetch code:2pp2]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1wcUZA9wmM6grAL3BvofBbQ)/[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iCkHXU55Or4gEtSqesijea6A5r8lVEYv)) here. Later, We will try different backbones based SINet to improve performance 
    and provide more comprehensive comparison.

    </p>

4. Evaluation your trained model:

    + One-key evaluation is written in MATLAB code (revised from [link](https://github.com/DengPingFan/CODToolbox)), 
    please follow this the instructions in `main.m` and just run it to generate the evaluation results in 
    `./EvaluationTool/EvaluationResults/Result-CamObjDet/`.
